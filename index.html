        <h2>How will your money be spent?</h2>
        <p>My friends and local volunteers are currently in Sunamganj working on the ground <br> to distribute dry food,
            hot
            meals and providing aid <br> to those affected by the severe flooding

        <h3>Food</h3>
        <p>The victims are brought to dry land, fed, clothed and sheltered. The community are working together to source
            rice, lentils and other food and water. Local volunteers and my friends cook around the clock and hand out
            food.</p>

        <h3>Shelter</h3>
        <p>The community is working together to house the victims temporarily on the mainland. We are working together
            to charge phones in areas that still have networks so that families can contact their loved ones and gather
            evidence of the catastrophe.</p>

        <h3>Future</h3>
        <p>Your money will help pay for everything in between, fuel for transport, equipment needed to support this
            operation. Should this campaign be successful, I will use funds to help rebuild the villages destroyed by
            the floods.</p>
